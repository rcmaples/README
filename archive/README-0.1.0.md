## 🥸 What do you want us to know about your communication style?

I have a tendency to over-communicate (or be redundant (👀)) when writing things... I generally try to explain something a few different ways if I think the content is complex or if I'm trying to put particular emphasis on something. If I'm becoming overly verbose, let me know 😅.

I 👏 over 👏 use 👏 emojis 👏.

I am incredibly anxious that something I say in slack, an internal comment in a ticket, or a linear card will be taken with the wrong tone. I tend to be direct without a lot of fluff, e.g., I'm the **worst** at just sliding into one's DMs with a question out of the blue. No "hello", or "'sup?", etc. I don't mean to be rude, I'm just absolute shit at small talk. So I try to convey intent via emoji.

Oh. And the gifs. So. Many. Gifs. I love'm. Can't live without'm. Would gladly take them as my only item on a deserted island.

## 🤔 What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

I'm not entirely sure what my style is, but Moira Rose once summarized it as

I'm bipolar and sometimes things get a little ... interesting. Throw in some anxiety and ADHD and you have yourself quite the internal monologue—rarely a dull moment. I'm prone to having feedback and opinions on a subject _after_ the meeting instead of during. If we're going to be having a planning / brainstorming / working meeting of somesort, I love to have a [pre-read](https://fellow.app/blog/meetings/why-you-need-to-send-a-meeting-pre-read/?v2=1) in advance with a quick "_this is what we're gonna cover; this is why it's important; this is what we want to achieve; we're going to discuss ideas for accomplishing x, y, z_".

I love using project plans for staying on task and planning some initiative. I generally prefer to work somewhere that allows us to collaborate and track things at the same time like Notion. I have several templates for things I find useful and am always looking for ways to optimize my organization.

I frequently lose my train of thought mid-sentence. I'm working on this, but just be aware it'll probably happen. A lot.

I need due dates / deadlines. I'm terrible at adhering to ones I've set for myself—sometimes.

## 🤝 How can you best work with me?

<p align="center"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExeGJjY3U0a3ZxcXplOTNnOHd4b2swbHo0b2t4bTg2ZGJsem52ZnVpMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/26gsd0fPH5O9l7EuA/giphy-downsized.gif" width="300px"></p>

I work best with clear expectations and direct feedback. If I've misstepped—let me know, point me to doc, etc... and provide feedback on how I could have done the thing better.

## 🤬 What are your pet peeves?

Criticism without also providing guidance on how to improve or how to solve an issue in a different manner.

## 🪜 What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I procrastinate... hooray for executive dysfunction!
- I tend to chase squirrels and occasionally go down too many tangents.
- I can get stuck focusing on trying to perfect every aspect of a project before starting it.

## 🏆 In Closing

I'm always down to chat about anything. If there's anything you want to bring up or talk about, just let me know!
